# teste_item5
- The SQL query that solves the test in written on item5.sql
- The SQL presents as a result a report with students names, your grades and marks 
- Students that got a grade less than 8 had theirs names to NULL.
- The report is in descending order by grade.
- For students with the same grade, they are sorted by their names(**).
- For students with the same grade and grade less than 8, they are sorte by their value in ascending order..

** there is a mistake on the question example. The studentes Marcela and Julia have the same grade (=9) and should be sorted by their names, but they are not on the question example. This example result was disconsidered and I assumed that the description was correct.
